This is antenna analyzer project based on Jim KW4KD version. I added :
- TUNE mode (similar like VK5JST has)
- two hardware buttons to make interaction with a user (selecting mode, up/down frequency in TUNE mode etc.)
- supply voltage meter
- rechargeable accumulators based on cellphone’s battery
- support for popular TFT 1.8″ ST7735 display
